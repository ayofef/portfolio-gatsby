After my college degree in **"Mass Communication"** which explored Broadcasting communications, Public relation and Advertising, I decided to change career path to client-side programming due to my **aptitude** in digital technology. I started my masters programme in **"Applied Digital Media"** in February 2018, at[Griffith College Dublin,](https://www.griffith.ie/) straight into the challenging world of Javascript using [p5*](https://p5js.org "the power of Processing times the reach of JavaScript").

It was a challenging experience because I had no programming experience at the time. I eventually fell in love with Javascript when i started to understand it's basic syntax and data structure (Loops, Arrays, GUI, Objects, Network Data...). At the completion of my masters programme, I was conversant with Web development and Publishing, Game design, 3D modelling, Interaction Design and Data Visualization but my interest in Web development and User experience design made me took the **career path** as a Front-end Developer.  Now, I design and develop experiences that make people's live simple.

I always want to learn more, do more and be more and I guess that was what made me took online courses like [Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/), [The Complete JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/), [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-javascript/), [React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/), [Gatsby Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM), among others.

I'm **hard working**, **super curious**, **passionate**, **dedicated**, and also a **fast learner!**
