description: "I have always wanted to develop a website with an appointment booking system and I took the oppurtunity of integrating it with Paard Interiors landing page. The appointment booking system was intergrated and customised using Wordpress. The right appointment booking plugin with optimum flexibility had to be paid for so I resulted to Contact form 7 plugin with input based on my specification. The only disadvantage this has is that users can select the same time slot which can cause confusion. Apart from that, everything works perfectly and for a real-life project, clients will be advised to pay for a wordpress plugin to avoid this confusion. Developed custom theme from Blankslate."
