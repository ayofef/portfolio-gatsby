description: "A movie library that fetches data from The Movie Databse and displays it with a crispy UI. Users get to explore all movies and tv series across different genres and categories and even get similar movies and tv series of movies they viewed. Each movies and tv series fetches details like the status of the movie (released or in production), release year, synopsis, ratings, cast and trailer that can be view directly from the details page. I enjoyed working on this project so much that I had to add authentication and allow users to add movies an Tv series to their collection, mark movie as watched and also remove movies from their collection."
